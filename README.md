this is a repo for my othello bot to store all the relavent files and have a virtual environment with the dependancies clearly listed
i forgot to update this file untill recently so erlier versions will still say its just for the MLP code

you havent updaded the requiremnts file since you added matplotlib so you should probably do that at some point
you didnt do this at the time as theres a lot of stuff there that your not sure should be and couldent be botherd dealing with it
